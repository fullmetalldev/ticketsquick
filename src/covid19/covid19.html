                    <span>To our valued customers:</span>
                    <span>This communication is designed to answer your questions about what happens if your event is canceled or postponed due to Covid-19, if no audience is allowed at your event, or if you do not attend an event due to attendance requirements based on Covid-19.</span>
                    <span>Our industry-leading guarantee continues to protect every purchase, and nothing about this situation has or will change that.
                    </span>
                    <span>If your event is canceled or if no audience is allowed, we will notify you as soon as possible. You may have the option of accepting a credit voucher good for 110% of the value of your original purchase, less applicable delivery fees - valid for one year from the effective date. You will also have the option of accepting a refund of your original purchase price, less applicable delivery fees.
                    </span>
                    <span>If your event is postponed or rescheduled, rest assured that your ticket will be honored on the new date of the event.
                    </span>
                    <span>Our customer support team is ready to answer any questions you may have.
                    </span>
                    <span>Sincerely,</span>
                    <span> Your Customer Care Team

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
                    <h3>Am I eligible for a Credit Voucher?</h3>
                    <span>If you purchased tickets to an event that has been cancelled and not rescheduled due to Covid-19, you may be eligible for a Credit Voucher. If you purchased tickets to an event that still takes place but has been closed to the public (no audience games, for example) due to Covid-19,
                    you are also eligible for a Credit Voucher.</span>
                    <h3>How much is my Credit Voucher for a cancelled performance worth?</h3>
                    <span>We are offering customers a Credit Voucher good for 110 % of the value of their original order, less applicable delivery charges. Example: you paid $100 for tickets to an event that has been cancelled due to Covid-19, plus $8.95 shipping and handling.
                        The voucher for this order would be good for $110 towards a future purchase.</span>
                    <h3>Can I get a Credit Voucher or a refund if I am denied entry or told to leave because I do not
                        comply with COVID-19 requirements?</h3>
                    <span>Unfortunately, no. To assure fansâ safety during these uncertain times, all tickets are subject to restrictions and requirements put in place by venues, teams, performers, promoters, or government authorities regarding social distancing, wearing personal protective gear, showing proof of Covid-19 vaccination or proof of a negative Covid-19 test, or similar requirements. If you cannot or do not attend or are asked to leave the event due to your failure or inability to comply with such requirements,
                        you will not receive a refund or a Credit Voucher.</span>
                    <h3>How will I receive my Credit Voucher?</h3>
                    <span>If your event is cancelled or closed to public (i.e. no audience permitted), we will contact you with details via an e-mail. It will include the amount of the Credit Voucher being offered,
                        as well as details on accepting the offer.</span>
                    <h3>How can I use my Credit Voucher?</h3>
                    <span>Your Credit Voucher will be valued at 110% of our original order (less applicable delivery fees). It will be valid for 365 days from the date of issue and can be applied towards future purchases
                        for events through the website of your original purchase.</span>
                    <h3>What if I want a refund?</h3>
                    <span>If you would prefer a refund rather than a voucher, you may choose a refund for the original order (less applicable delivery charges). You will have the option to choose a refund when contacted regarding the cancellation of your event or the fact that no audience is allowed.</span>
                    <span>Refunds will typically take up to 30 days to process from the date you notify us that you want a refund.</span>
                    <h3>Why will it take up to 30 days?</h3>
                    <span>We are dealing with an unprecedented situation caused by a global pandemic, and refund processing times are impacted by the sheer volume of events impacted.</span>
                    <h3>My event is postponed, can I get a Credit Voucher?</h3>
                    <span>Unfortunately, we cannot offer refunds for events that organizers have chosen to reschedule or postpone indefinitely due to Covid-19. Your original tickets will remain valid for the rescheduled event.
                        You will be contacted when a new date is set for your event.</span>
                    <h3>What happens if I don't want to or unable go to an event on the new date?</h3>
                    <span>If an event is not cancelled, we cannot offer a refund or a Credit Voucher. Consumers can list tickets that they do not intend to use for resale at tickettocash.com.</span>
                    <h3>What happens if I want to purchase tickets, but they cost more (or less) than my Credit
                        Voucher?</h3>
                    <span>You can use the value of your Credit Voucher for separate purchases, until youâve used the full amount. However, you must use all amounts on the Credit Voucher by the 'valid through' date. Any remaining value will be forfeited at the expiration of the 365-day period from the date the Credit Voucher was issued to you.</span>
                    <h3>Can I use my Credit Voucher to buy tickets in another country or from another website?</h3>
                    <span>The Credit Voucher will be valid only on the website of your original purchase, and in the original currency of your purchase. If the Site where your original purchase was made is no longer in service, your Credit Voucher will still be honored. Contact Customer Support at +1 (888) 456-8499 and we will assist you in reissuing your Credit Voucher so you can use it on www.ticketnetwork.com.</span>
                    <h3>Can I get cash for or sell my Credit Voucher?</h3>
                    <span>The Credit Voucher has no cash value, cannot be redeemed for cash, and cannot be transferred.</span>
